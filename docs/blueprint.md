# **App Name**: Shape Shooter Showdown

## Core Features:

- Score Tracking: Tracks the player's score, incrementing by one for each opponent successfully converted into a star.
- Lives System: Implements a lives system for the player, starting with three lives. Decreases lives when the player is hit by an enemy shot.
- Game Over Condition: Ends the game when the player runs out of lives, displaying a 'game over' screen.  A win screen should appear after defeating the boss.
- Advanced Opponent (Boss): Introduces a more challenging 'boss' opponent (pentagon) that appears after the player successfully converts a triangle into a star. This boss moves faster and has tougher gameplay mechanics.
- Score and Lives Display: Displays the current score and remaining lives on the game screen in real-time.
- Collision Detection: Checks if any shot collide with player and/or opponents.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for an energetic and modern feel.
- Background color: Dark gray (#222222) to provide high contrast and focus on gameplay elements.
- Accent color: Neon green (#39FF14) to highlight interactive elements and scores.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, tech-inspired look that suits both headlines and game text.  Consider 'Inter' for longer text sections.
- Use simple, geometric icons for game elements such as lives and power-ups.
- Keep the layout clean and uncluttered to ensure a focus on the core gameplay area.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions, explosions, and when converting shapes to stars.
