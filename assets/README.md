# Assets

This directory contains app assets like icons and splash screens.

## Required Assets

For a complete Expo app, you should add the following files:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px recommended)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon

You can generate these using:
- Online tools like https://appicon.co/
- Design tools like Figma or Sketch
- Or use the Expo asset generator

## Temporary Setup

For development, the app can run without these assets, but they should be added before publishing.
